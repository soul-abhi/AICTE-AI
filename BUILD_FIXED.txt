✅ BUILD ERROR FIXED!

The problem was a duplicate button element in RegisterPage.tsx
This has been fixed and pushed to GitHub.

==============================================
WHAT WAS WRONG:
==============================================

In client/src/pages/RegisterPage.tsx, there were TWO button elements:

❌ BEFORE (BROKEN):
<button type="submit" ...>
  {loading ? 'Creating account...' : 'Create Account'}
</button>
<button className="...">    <-- DUPLICATE!
  Sign up
</button>

✅ AFTER (FIXED):
<button type="submit" ...>
  {loading ? 'Creating account...' : 'Create Account'}
</button>

==============================================
BUILD STATUS:
==============================================

✅ Local build: PASSES
✅ Code pushed to GitHub: SUCCESS
✅ Vercel will auto-deploy: YES

==============================================
NEXT STEPS FOR VERCEL:
==============================================

1. Go to: https://vercel.com
2. Check your project - should auto-deploy now
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete

IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST DEPLOYMENT:
You still need to add environment variables!

Check VERCEL_SETUP.txt for:
- How to add 6 environment variables
- How to configure MongoDB whitelist

IF BUILD STILL FAILS ON VERCEL:
1. Check Vercel build logs
2. Make sure Node version is 18.x or higher
3. Make sure Build Command is: npm run vercel-build
4. Make sure Output Directory is: client/dist

==============================================
YOUR APP WORKS LOCALLY:
==============================================

Backend: http://localhost:5000 ✅
Frontend: http://localhost:5173 ✅
MongoDB: Connected ✅

Test locally first to confirm everything works!
